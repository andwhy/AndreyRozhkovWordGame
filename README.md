# AndreyRozhkovWordGame

-  How much time was invested 
  6h
-  How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics)
  SwiftUI, MVVM, Models, simplified View Router
-  Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game
  To create 25% correct word pairs distribution I create pairs array for every game round
- Decisions made because of restricted time
  simplified View Router, small test coverage, no device rotation, small views separation
-  What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time
  Better routing
