# AndreyRozhkovWordGame

-  How much time was invested  <br/>
6h
-  How was the time distributed (concept, model layer, view(s), game mechanics) <br/>
  SwiftUI, MVVM, Models, simplified View Router
-  Decisions made to solve certain aspects of the game <br/>
  To create 25% correct word pairs distribution I create pairs array for every game round <br/>
- Decisions made because of restricted time <br/>
  simplified View Router, small test coverage, no device rotation, small views separation
-  What would be the first thing to improve or add if there had been more time <br/>
  Better routing
